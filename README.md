Google Chrome does not let you turn off anti-alias through the user style sheet so it can only be done through an extension.

Also, Chrome has a "bug" which they pretty much won't fix so it's disable it for all sites or no-sites.

This is a little extension that disable anti-alias but has a button that lets you turn it on for a site if that sites looks
too bad without anti-alias.
